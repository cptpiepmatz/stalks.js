## What's this?

If you play animal crossing, especially the new horizons you may have the seen the character [Daisy Mae](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Daisy_Mae). She sells you turnips which you can later sell. To improve your results you may want to track the prices. That caused the website [stalks.io](https://stalks.io). It allows you to track the prices and show you a predicition.

If you happen to be patron of this at level 2 you can use the api to interact with the page. This library/module allows you to easily interact with the api via [node](https://nodejs.org/) or [deno](https://deno.land).
